Note: Makefile has to be called from a3 directory and not the jotto directory


My Enhancements: 
  1. I have added multiplayer so that 2 people can play against each other
     (Wanted to play with my friends)
  2. In the single player mode you can choose the level of difficulity and 
     the difficulity is based on the difficulity associated with words
     in the dictionary (words.txt)
  3. I have added a set of hints I think are very useful
     The hints have their own view class


To simplify the marking task I have added a feature by which you can 
just choose the target word yourself. When you run the program with
single player, it will ask you if you want to choose the target word
or not.
