This was a UI course project through which I familiarized myself with MVC design pattern, using a light-weight GUI toolkit
and some Java-specific techniques such as listeners and inner classes.

Compilation notes
- "make run" will compile and execute the game
- "make clean" will remove the class files

More details: 
  1. I have added multiplayer so that 2 people can play against each other
     (Wanted to play with my friends)
  2. In the single player mode you can choose the level of difficulity and 
     the difficulity is based on the difficulity associated with words
     in the dictionary (words.txt)
  3. I have added a set of hints I think are very useful
     The hints have their own view class
